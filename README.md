# leetcode-python
My python and C++ solution and thinking for leetcode algorithm questions
After I suffered from Python perfomance limit, I switched to C++.   
(Especially when dealing with lists, many wired TLE cases).

Also the lessons for python:  
+ The shallow copy and deep copy.
+ The reference and objects.
+ Inner function of method and other memeber functions.
